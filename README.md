## Overview

### Portfolio Website

For this project, you will build a personal portfolio site, a static website where you can share the projects that you build in this Path. Typically, a portfolio website will have a main page that features different projects that you’ve built and another page that contains contact information, in case someone wants to reach out to you. Occasionally, there are additional pages for each project, detailing the technology used.

## Setup

Going off platform:
You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we suggest [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) and Git version control. If you need help setting up your text editor, read our [article about setting up a text editor for web development](https://www.codecademy.com/article/visual-studio-code). If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for version control, [review the Git lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) or look at this [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).

### Debugging Tips + Helpful Resources

Feeling stuck? Try the following:

Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how other folks have found solutions.
Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.
